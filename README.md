The code consists of two primary classes, Binary and App, as well as the corresponding unit tests, BinaryTest and AppTest. An overview of the planning and execution is provided below:

Binary Class
Represents a binary variable with unsigned integers. In addition to handling situations like out-of-range digits, alphabetic characters, negative signs, zero trailing, and empty strings, the constructor guarantees valid binary input and offers ways to get the binary value and carry out operations on binary values, including multiplication, bitwise AND, bitwise OR, and addition.

BinaryTest Class
Includes unit tests covering a range of constructor and binary operation scenarios for the Binary class and makes sure the Binary class responds appropriately to various input scenarios and behaves as expected.

App Class
Acts as the program's primary point of entry and uses the Binary class to carry out binary operations on input from the user.
It accepts two binary numbers as input, executes the chosen operation (multiplication, bitwise AND, bitwise OR, addition), and outputs the outcome.

AppTest Class
Simple unit test class with a single, always-passing test (shouldAnswerWithTrue). It's possible that this test is a stand-in and doesn't cover all of the App class's features.

Functionality of the Binary Class is to offer numerous methods for working with binary numbers, such as validation when creating objects and different binary operations.

The use of AppTest and BinaryTest as unit tests shows that the functionality of the code is being tested. The tests improve code reliability by covering a variety of scenarios.
By taking binary input, processing user-selected actions, and displaying the outcome, the App class enables user interaction.
